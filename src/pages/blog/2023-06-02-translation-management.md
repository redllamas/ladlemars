Outdated translation management strategies resulted in unnecessary time and manpower spent on redoing translations. By implementing CAT (Computer Assisted Translation) tools for all translators, we could better manage translations and terminology, and reduce workload for future translations

### Highlights

- **Translations for all languages were managed in Excel per project, meaning human error and time needed to check previous projects each time**
- **Introducing CAT tools (and later Translation Management System) would reduce human error and improve consistency of terminology**
- **Selected, implemented and managed translation infrastructure, and integrations with other tools**
- **More languages handled with shorter turnaround**

## What was the situation?

TLV, a globally recognised steam trap manufacturer, creates a variety of documents in the languages of the markets it serves. In addition, local laws and regulations demand that documentation in some languages must be provided as the responsibility of the manufacturer.

These requirements mean translations must be managed efficiently to keep resources in line, however this was not the case.
Translations were managed in Excel on a per project basis, and for similar products, the translator would need to either remember or reexamine terminology.

As a very late entry to the world of CAT tools, TLV implemented Trados Studio in 2019.

## What did I do?

As a newcomer to translation management and CAT tools, I contacted several software providers and translation agencies for their advice and product information.

After confirming which system would solve the needs in HQ and be accessible for the necessary proofreading tasks at the overseas sales offices, we settled on Trados Studio in 2019.

To obtain approval for the budget, I had to educate and persuade senior management of the need to create a more sustainable translation infrastructure.

## What came next?

Further down the line, it became clear that the future of translation was not on desktop platforms, but in the cloud.

I began examining other solutions that enabled further integration with other tools in our toolchain, for example the Drupal CMS on which our website was built.

Focusing on the interconnectivity of services that required translation, and managing the translation infrastructure with a roadmap, allow TLV to move ahead with the next phase of our translation management journey.

Currently we are close to introducing Phrase TMS, a market-leading translation management system that integrates all translation-using services on the team.


## What were the results?

The results of the initial CAT tool implementation was a dramatic reduction in the time required for each translation project, as it was no longer needed to examine past projects - the software search the translation memory in seconds.

The current project phase is not yet complete, however I expect to see a great expansion in our translation volume.
Where we previously could not dedicate resources to translation all content in all languages for all media, everything will now be linked to the central TMS, allowing the team to proceed with previously underserviced areas (for example, Thai datasheets or new languages for the website)
