Two legacy sites on different platforms were merged and renewed to deliver a seamless experience for users in Japan and around the world. The new site extends how we can deliver value to our users and internal stakeholders.

### Highlights

- **Former website split between Japan and global sites, requiring 2 teams**
- **Website merged and renewed, delivering productivity gains and enabling collaboration with stakeholders**
- **Consistent branding across all regions and more secure, reliable operation**
- **Conversions, lead generation improving**

## What was the situation?

TLV, a globally recognised steam trap manufacturer, identified the need for a website renewal to streamline business processes, stay competitive in the market and cater to evolving customer expectations. The existing website was actually comprised of two separate platforms/CMS for Japan and the rest of the world, necessitating two teams to operate it.
One objective was to integrate these two sites to lower business overheads on website operation and maintain branding consistency. However, the project faced several challenges, including adapting content from a site with an outdated design, migration of a high volume of content, and how to deliver the project on time and on budget.

## What did I do?

I was tasked with leading the website renewal project as the senior project manager, liaising between the project manager and corporate management.
From start to finish, the project had to select the ideal CMS platform for secure, reliable, and multilingual content management, define the requirements of the new site, identify opportunities to improve on the old site, maintain branding consistency, migrate the content from the old site, test then publish the final site.

The website represents one of the strengths of the company, a strong local marketing presence, serving 20 regions in 13 languages.

We decided on Drupal as a CMS, which ticked several boxes in terms of reliability and multi-language support. Drupal is commonly used for US government websites, e.g. the White House and NASA websites have used Drupal for many years.

## How did I do it?

While much of the day-to-day project operation I delegated to the project manager, as senior project manager I provided regular updates to senior management and relayed key requests from management back to the project team.
In addition, as a native English speaker with good basic understanding of the unique requirements of the languages served by our website and drawing on past experience in design, I was able to provide valuable input to the project team in areas of UX/UI design, typography, information architecture, and others.

I also maintained close contact with our overseas sales offices, educating them about Drupal content management and which features would be available to them after publishing the site.

The initial phase of the project was the requirement definitions, to form a basis of truth for between TLV and the development agency for the forthcoming development and content migration.

This meant keen analysis of the existing sites and to establish a clear vision for the upcoming integrated site, which was far more difficult than anticipated due to the size of the website, the updated workflow, and at that time untested online collaboration with overseas sales offices.
I liaised between the overseas office and Japan HQ, obtaining consensus for the website requirements.

The next phase was content migration. With approximately 5000 pages of content to migrate, I created methods for tracking migration process, reallocated team resources, and obtained additional support for the project.
In hindsight, I could have improved how I allocated resources by pausing non-essential projects, or renegotiating deadlines.

Finally, after migrating all the content, it was necessary to confirm the new site with overseas sales offices before release. This was needed primarily for translation checks for new sections, but also to make sure the site addressed the key requirements communicated by those overseas stakeholders in the requirement definition phase.

## What were the results?

In terms of results, the renewal project yielded significant positive outcomes.
Overseas sales offices can now add content in some sections without needed to request support from our team at HQ. This saves both sides some time when adding news stories, updating recruitment posts or notices for exhibitions, etc.

The new design and workflow ensured brand consistency across the global and Japanese sections, and importantly allowed us to combine efforts from administering two sites into one team.
This produced new challenges, such as hitherto global team members working with the Japanese sales teams for the first time.

Most importantly, website visits, conversions and lead generation metrics are all up, so by most accounts the renewal has been a success, with plenty of opportunities for analysis and improvement.
