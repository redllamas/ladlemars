Migrating from a work-intensive legacy format to a cloud-based platform, TLV streamlined its documentation control and reduced time spent on low-value work processes.

### Highlights

- **Legacy format and workflow demanded large manpower, prone to error**
- **Migrating to cloud-based CCMS (Component Contents Management System) allowed streamlined workflow and freed up manpower for other tasks**
- **Next phase of the project will see all language versions consolidated on new platform, adding further optimization gains**
- **Furthermore, other document such as datasheets also planned for migration, to deliver the same improvements across document portfolio**


## What was the situation?

From 1995 until 2022, TLV’s instruction manuals were created and maintained in single Microsoft Word documents stored on the company’s local servers.
This meant it was necessary to update manuals individually for all affected products in all languages.
Even something like a sales office address change meant editing hundreds of manuals.

Due to limited manpower, in practice corrections would be shelved until a critical change came along, meaning a time lag between change being issued and published to the manual. 

Another problem was version control. Rules for version control were in place, however when working across several languages or working concurrently with other departments, arbitrary versioning introduced complexity and hampered collaboration efforts.

Manual document control and versioning meant the entire process was prone to human error. To prevent this, time-consuming double check processes were enabled, and even small corrections required the whole document to be checked thoroughly, in case of any layout errors or bugs from the old Word format.

This style of document management also depended heavily on personnel to be familiar with the contents. There was a lot for new personnel to remember, and this made it difficult to allocate team resources.

## What did I do?

In our department’s efforts to bring our product instruction manuals into the 21st century, we identified that implementing a Component Content Management System (CCMS) would help solve several of the problems we faced. 
This enabled us to shift from the legacy MS Word format to a new platform capable of single-source publishing, automatic versioning, revision history and full review functions.

I was tasked with selecting and implementing the system to use, including obtaining budget approval from senior management and accounting.

## How did I do it?

To do so, I presented the benefits of installation and the options we had at our disposal, namely the various software solutions. This presentation included complex information, comparing the current work processes and cost of maintenance, including technical debt, with the potential new CCMSs and the benefits they could offer. 
By switching to a platform capable of single-source publishing, we would save time and money in the long run by removing the need to convert the material a second time.

## What were the results?

The result was approval for the implementation of Paligo, a cloud-based CCMS, and the project to migrate our legacy manuals to the platform. 

Paligo encourages writers to reuse content as much as possible, so previously laborious find/replace jobs for updating simple details like addresses could be done in one change.

It also keeps documents much more organized, with drag-and-drop menus for topic arrangement.

Here is a sample of one completed manual.

The first phase of the migration project is approaching completion. Feedback from the company’s overseas sales offices, which are often contact points with customers regarding the documentation, is  positive concerning the improved speed of correction, the ability to review the manuals in their languages, and the potential for publishing HTML manuals in the future.

In terms of the labor-intensive document control of the legacy format, we have been able to dedicate more time to making meaningful changes to manuals, and allocating more time to other tasks.

The next phase will see non-English language manuals also migrated to the new format, and following that we will issue HTML versions of the manual to make product documentation more accessible.
